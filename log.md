# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2, 2016 (3:45-4:45)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed menu issue on mobile PPR site using a custom plugin (theme's javascript wasn't working). Made some CSS changes on the Litigateways site.

**Thoughts:** I had been putting off doing th plugin for the menu because I thought it would be more difficult, but it was a very simple fix using jQuery. Would like to get litigateways site live by tomrrow and move on to some php/laravel projects.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
